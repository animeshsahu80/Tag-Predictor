# Question-Tag-Predictor
StackOverflow allows users to manually assignbetween one and five tags to a posting.  Users areencouraged to use existing tags that are suggestedby  typing  the  first  letter  of  a  tag  but  they  are also allowed to create new ones, so the set of possible tags is infinite. While the manual tagging byusers generally works well for experienced users,it  can  be  challenging  for  inexperienced  users  tofind appropriate tags for their question and by let-ting users add new tags it is likely that differentusers  use  different  orthographic  versions  of  tagsthat mean the same thing such as “php5” and “php-5”. For these reasons it is desirable to a have a sys-tem that is able to either automatically tag ques-tions or to suggest relevant tags to a user based onthe question content.
Problem Statemtent:  Suggest the tags based on the content that was there in the question posted on Stackoverflow.
